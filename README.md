# Random-Password-Generator
Scrimba project w/ stretch goals

Things learned:

-devised my own way of incorporating Num and Special Characters into the password generation using boleans and if else statements.
-'simple' implication of copy to clipboard wasnt so simple for me until i realized the field needed to be set to 'innertext'...can also be done with 'value'?
-adding stretch goals without planning for then in the beginning caused some layout difficulties.

struggles:

-wanted to modify the pop up to be a styled bar along the bottom (saw someone else's who did it), but havent figured it out yet.
